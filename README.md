# Console To-Do List 

 A simple To-Do List application written in C#. It allows you to:

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Save/load tasks to/from a file (`tasks.txt`)

## File Storage

- All tasks are saved in a local file named `tasks.txt`.
- Tasks marked as done will show as `[x] Task`, and those still pending will show as `[ ] Task`.
